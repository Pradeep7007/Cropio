# 🌾 AI for Sustainable Agriculture with Multi-Agent System

This project integrates **Machine Learning (ML)** and **multi-agent systems** to promote sustainable agriculture.  
It empowers farmers with intelligent insights and connects them directly with dealers or buyers — reducing middlemen and ensuring fair pricing.

## 🚜 Farmer-Side Features

- **Crop Disease Detection:**  
  ML-based image analysis identifies crop diseases early and suggests appropriate treatment measures.

- **Yield Estimation:**  
  Predicts potential yield using trained ML models based on environmental and crop data.

- **Crop Recommendation:**  
  Suggests the most suitable crops according to soil conditions, climate, and market trends.

## 🧑‍💼 Dealer/Buyer-Side Features

- **Direct Farmer Interaction:**  
  Dealers can connect directly with farmers, promoting transparency and reducing intermediaries.

- **Demand Tracking:**  
  Helps dealers estimate availability and demand for specific crops.

- **Smart Marketplace:**  
  Facilitates smooth transactions and fair pricing between farmers and buyers.
